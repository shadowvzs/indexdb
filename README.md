# indexedDB
IndexDB with promises

#### What is indexDB?
Who don't know what is it then please read this article: https://javascript.info/indexeddb

#### Why this was created?
Since indexedDb based on event and callback sometimes should be enough annoying the usage, so i wrap that part with promise,
so the useage became more clear with async and await.

### Feature
  - add/update/delete/get/findFirst methods
  - add/delete/drop/connect/disconnect to database
  - relationships and get data with relationships (getJoin, findFirstJoin)
